A client server implementation in python for the number guess problem. The server chooses a random number. The clients connect and send numbers to server. The server returns to each client a status message:

·         ‘H’ – send a larger number

·         ‘S’ – send a lower number

·         ‘G’ – you guessed my number

·         ‘L’ – another client guessed the number. You are a looser !
