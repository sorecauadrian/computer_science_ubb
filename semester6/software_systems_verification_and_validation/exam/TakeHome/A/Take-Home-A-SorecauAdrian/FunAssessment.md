## Part 1 – DIXIT Card: Equivalence Partitioning

### Description:

This card illustrates **equivalence class partitioning**, a black-box testing technique where input values are grouped into valid and invalid classes. A whimsical "magic sorting hat" assigns values to buckets: *Valid*, *Invalid Low*, and *Invalid High*.

### How to Use in Game:

Players can use this card to represent the strategy of choosing one value from each class in a test case. It helps remember that fewer well-chosen tests can still ensure strong coverage.

## Part 2 – Scenario: Why Do Bugs Occur?

### Description:

This drawing shows a tired developer juggling multiple responsibilities: deadlines, unclear requirements, coffee, and bugs. Amid the chaos, a small but critical “edge case” is forgotten, symbolizing how bugs occur under pressure.

### Meaning:

It highlights real-world causes of bugs: tight deadlines, multitasking, and incomplete specifications. A reminder that good processes and communication are key to preventing them.
