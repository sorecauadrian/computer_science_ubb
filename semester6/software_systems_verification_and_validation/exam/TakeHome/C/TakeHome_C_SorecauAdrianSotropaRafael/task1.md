# Task 1 – Summary: *Engaging Young Learners with Testing Using the Code Critters Mutation Game*

**Aim of the Research Study**  
This study aims to address the challenge of teaching software testing to young learners in an engaging and accessible manner. Traditional testing concepts can be abstract and difficult to grasp for early learners. To overcome this, the researchers introduce the *Code Critters Mutation Game*, a physical and interactive educational tool designed to teach core principles of software testing—particularly mutation testing—through play and collaboration.

**Methodology of the Study**  
The researchers developed the Code Critters game as a tangible teaching tool where students act as programmers and testers using creature-like representations of programs. They conducted a series of workshops with elementary school children (ages 10–12) across multiple sessions. The study involved observation, interviews, and analysis of student responses to evaluate engagement levels, understanding of testing concepts, and overall educational impact. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected to assess learning outcomes and user experiences.

**Results**  
The study found that students were highly engaged and successfully grasped foundational testing concepts like identifying and fixing bugs, understanding test cases, and the idea of mutants in code. The tangible and game-based format proved to be effective in demystifying software testing. Participants enjoyed the collaborative and playful learning process, and the results demonstrated measurable improvements in their understanding of software testing principles.

**Implication for Research and for Practice**  
For research, this study highlights the potential of physical, game-based learning tools in computer science education, particularly in making abstract concepts more accessible to younger audiences. It opens avenues for future studies on how such tools can be scaled and adapted for broader curricula. For practice, educators can incorporate similar gamified teaching aids to introduce software engineering topics earlier in school programs, promoting computational thinking and testing literacy from a young age.
