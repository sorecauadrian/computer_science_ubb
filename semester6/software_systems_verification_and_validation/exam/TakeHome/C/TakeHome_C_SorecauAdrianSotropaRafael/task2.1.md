**Title:** *Test Maintenance for Machine Learning Systems: A Case Study in the Automotive Industry*  
**Conference:** ICST 2023 (IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification and Validation)  
**Authors:** Lukas Berglund, Tim Grube, Gregory Gay, Francisco Gomes de Oliveira Neto, Dimitrios Platis  
**DOI:** 10.1109/ICST57167.2023.00043

**Aim of the Research Study**  
This study investigates the challenges and practices associated with test maintenance in machine learning (ML) systems, particularly within the automotive industry. As ML models evolve, maintaining effective and up-to-date test suites becomes crucial to ensure system reliability and safety.

**Methodology of the Study**  
The researchers conducted a case study in the automotive sector, analyzing the test maintenance processes of ML systems. They examined how test cases are updated in response to changes in ML models and the impact of these updates on system performance. Data was collected through interviews, documentation analysis, and observation of testing practices.

**Results**  
Findings revealed that test maintenance for ML systems is often reactive, with updates made post hoc following model changes. This approach can lead to periods where tests are misaligned with the current model, potentially missing defects. The study highlights the need for proactive test maintenance strategies that anticipate model evolution.

**Implication for Research and for Practice**  
For researchers, the study underscores the importance of developing methodologies that integrate test maintenance into the ML development lifecycle. Practitioners are encouraged to adopt proactive maintenance practices, such as continuous integration and automated test generation, to keep pace with model changes and maintain system integrity.
