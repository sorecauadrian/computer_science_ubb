|:---:| -------------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | D_01 – Incomplete Requirements         | 3.1 (FR7.0)     | The filtering functionality is described too vaguely without clear criteria or parameters.                                                                                  |
| 2   | D_02 - Missing Requirements            | 3.1 (FR4.0)     | Didn't mention the fact that "The app will offer the ability to unsubscribe from these notifications"                                                                       |
| 3   | D_02 - Missing Requirements            | 3.1 (FR2.0)     | Didn't mention the fact that "any delays due to delays in delivery of a theme will be automatically calculated, showing the student's maximum mark on the topic"            |
| 4   | D_01 - Incomplete Requirements         | 3.1 (FR1.0)     | There is an inconsistency in the CRUD description: while FR1.0 focuses on student operations, section 4 also mention deleting assignments and grades without clear details. |
| 5   | D_06 – Inadequate User Needs Statement | 3.2             | The user interface and usability requirements are very generic (e.g., "user friendly", "easy to learn") and do not offer concrete guidelines or measurable criteria.        |
