**Goal:**  
To evaluate how the application of different levels of exploratory testing impacts student learning outcomes and testing effectiveness in a higher education software engineering course.

**Question(s):**

1. How do different levels of exploratory testing affect students’ ability to detect critical software defects?

2. Does the level of exploration influence students’ engagement and perceived learning during testing activities?

**Methodology:**  
Conduct a controlled experiment with undergraduate software engineering students divided into three groups, each using one of three levels of exploratory testing (Freestyle, Medium, Fully Scripted) during practical lab sessions. Students will test the same software system using test charters aligned with their assigned level. Pre- and post-test surveys will measure engagement and self-perceived learning. Defects found will be logged and categorized by severity.

**Metrics:**

- Number of defects found (categorized by severity)

- Time spent per defect

- Pre/post surveys on engagement and learning (Likert scale)

- Qualitative reflections submitted by students about their testing experience

- Grading of students’ test reports for depth and clarity
