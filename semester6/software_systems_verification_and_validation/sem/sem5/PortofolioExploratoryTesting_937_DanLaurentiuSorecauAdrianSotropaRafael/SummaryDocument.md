**Aim:**  
The paper investigates how exploratory testing (ET) can be structured along a continuum of exploration, rather than as a binary choice between exploratory and scripted testing. It introduces a framework with five levels of exploration based on the structure of test charters, to help practitioners tailor testing approaches to their context.

**Methodology:**  
The study involved the development of a five-level classification system for exploratory testing, ranging from freestyle to fully scripted. This classification was based on prior work on test charter checklists and refined through the analysis of real-world test charters. The framework was then evaluated via focus groups conducted at four Swedish companies (Sony Mobile, Ericsson, Axis Communications, and Softhouse Consulting), with 20 experienced testers providing feedback.

**Results:**  
The classification into five levels - Freestyle, High, Medium, Low, and Fully Scripted - helped testers understand and apply varying degrees of exploratory testing. Factors influencing the choice of level included defect detection ability, learning potential, required effort, traceability, adaptability to change, and suitability for conformance testing. Higher levels of exploration were seen as more effective for defect discovery and learning, while lower levels offered better traceability and reproducibility.

**Implications for Research and Practice:**  
This framework contributes a practical way to differentiate exploratory testing approaches and tailor them to project needs. It aids researchers in framing ET more granularly and supports practitioners in structuring test charters and aligning testing strategies to team skill levels and project goals. The study also highlights the value of combining exploratory and scripted testing for comprehensive quality assurance.
