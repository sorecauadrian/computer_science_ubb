registration plates problem, laboratory 3, ticle daniel

ex:

from:
IS I1 AAA
B 1I AAI
IF II IAA
VS 11 AIA
CJ 28 ATM

the text file should be modified in order to obtain:
IS 11 AAA
B 11 AAI
IF 11 IAA
VS 11 AIA
CJ 28 ATM

solution (partially, because i don't know how to solve it without a pipe):

sed -E 's/([A-Z]+ )(.?)(I)(.?)( [A-Z]+)/\1\21\4\5/g' registration_plates.txt | sed -E 's/([A-Z]+ )(.?)(I)(.?)( [A-Z]+)/\1\21\4\5/g'
