Create two processes A and B. A generates a random number n between 50 and 200. If it is even, it sends it to B, if it is odd it sends n+1 to B. B receives the number and divides it by 2 and sends it back to A. The process repeats until n is smaller than 5. The processes will print the value of n at each step.
