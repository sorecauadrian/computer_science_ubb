3. Write a C program that creates a child process. Both the parent and the child processes will run until they receive a SIGUSR1 signal. Implement signal handling such that if the parent receives the SIGUSR1 signal first, it sends it to the child process as well. If the child process receives a SIGUSR1 signal without the parent receiving the same signal, it will terminate and then the parent should correctly call wait for the child process.
