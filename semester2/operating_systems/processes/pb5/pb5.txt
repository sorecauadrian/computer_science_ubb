Write a C program that implements the boltz game. Exactly N processes (numbered 1 to N, where N is given) take turns incrementing a number, starting from 1, and sending it to the next process. Process 1 starts the game by incrementing the number and sends it to process 2, which increments and sends it to process 3 and so on. Process N will send the number back to process 1, ant the cycle starts again. Each process must print the number it sends, unless the number contains the digit 7 or is divisible by 7, in which case it must print "boltz". Implement so that each process has a 1 in 3 chance to fail printing "boltz" when it should, in which case the game stops.
