Write a C program (we'll refer to it as A) that creates a child process B. Process B generates one random number N between 100 and 1000. Process A keeps generating and sending random numbers between 50 and 1050 to B until the absolute difference between the number generated by A and the number generated by B is less than 50. B prints the generated numbers and all the received numbers. A will print at the end the number of numbers generated until the stop condition was met.
