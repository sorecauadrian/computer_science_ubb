Write a C program that reads a number N and creates 2 threads. One of the threads will generate an even number and will append it to an array that is passed as a parameter to the thread. The other thread will do the same, but using odd numbers. Implement a synchronization between the two threads so that they alternate in appending numbers to the array, until they reach the maximum length N.
