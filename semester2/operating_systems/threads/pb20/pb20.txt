Write a C program that takes as command line arguments 2 numbers: N and M. The program will simulate a thread race that have to pass through M checkpoints. Through each checkpoint the threads must pass one at a time (no 2 threads can be inside the same checkpoint). Each thread that enters a checkpoint will wait between 100 and 200 milliseconds (usleep(100000) makes a thread or process wait for 100 milliseconds) and will print a message indicating the thread number and the checkpoint number, then it will exit the checkpoint. Ensure that no thread will try to pass through a checkpoint until all threads have been created.
