What can you do as a software developer to prevent deadlocks?

solution:
lock ordering: ensure that all threads acquire locks in a consistent global order. for example, if there are two mutexes, always aquire m[0] before m[1]. this prevents circular wait conditions.

avoid nested locks: minimize or avoid nested locking where possible. if a thread needs multiple resources, redesign the program to acquire them sequentially without holding multiple locks simultaneously.
