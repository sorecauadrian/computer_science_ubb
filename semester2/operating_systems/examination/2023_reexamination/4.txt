What state transition will a process undergo when it calls sem_wait and under what conditions? Justify your answer.

solution:
if the semaphore value is greater than 0, the process continues running
if the semaphore is 0 or less, the process transitions to the blocked state and waits until the semaphore becomes available

explanation:
if the semaphore value is greater than 0, the process decrements the semaphore value and remains in the running state because it has successfully acquired the resource
if the semaphore value is 0 or less, the process cannot decrement the semaphore value, it transitions to the blocked state and is added to the semaphore's waiting queue
