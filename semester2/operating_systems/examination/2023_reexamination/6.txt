What could happen if function f were executed by several simultaneous threads? Why?

pthread_mutex_t m[2];
void* f(void* p)
{
	int id = (int) p;
	pthread_mutex_t* first = &m[id % 2];
	pthread_mutex_t* second = &m[(id + 1) % 2];

	pthread_mutex_lock(first);
	pthread_mutex_lock(second);
	...
	pthread_mutex_unlock(second);
	pthread_mutex_unlock(first);
}

solution:
