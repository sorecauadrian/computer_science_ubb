What are the possible console outputs of the following code fragment (ignoring any output that execl might generate), and when will they happen?

printf("A\n"); execl(.....); printf("B\n");

solution:
the possible console output will be "A", but the output "B" will not be printed due to the 'execl' call
the 'execl' funcion is used to replace the current process with a new process, so any code after it will not be executed.

note: not really sure about this answer
