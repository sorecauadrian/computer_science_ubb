Considering that functions "fa" and "fb" are run in concurrent threads, what will the value of "n" be after the threads are finished? why?

pthread_mutex_t a, b;
int n = 0;
void* fa(void *p)
{
	pthread_mutex_lock(&a);
	n++;
	pthread_mutex_unlock(&a);
}
void* fb(void* p)
{
	pthread_mutex_lock(&b);
        n++;
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&b);
}

solution:
the final value of "n" will be 2 because each thread increments "n" by 1 when it acquires its respective mutex lock.
