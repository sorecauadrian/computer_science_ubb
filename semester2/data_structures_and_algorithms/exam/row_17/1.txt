We want to implement a Queue which has two special operations besided the regular Queue operations: getMiddle (returns the element from the middle of the Queue, for example, if the Queue has 7 elements, it returns the 4th element, if the Queue has 6 elements, it returns the 3rd or the 4th) and popMiddle (removes the middle element). We want both of these operations and all the other Queue operations to run in theta(1). Pick a suitable data structure for representing the Queue, implement the popMiddle, pop and push operations and explain in short how the other operations would be implemented (at most 2 sentences per operation).
